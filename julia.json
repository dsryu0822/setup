	// Place your snippets for julia here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"usingbasic": {
		"prefix": "usingbasic",
		"body": [
			"using Base.Threads: @threads, nthreads # Base.Threads.nthreads()",
			"using ProgressMeter",
			"packages = [:CSV, :DataFrames]",
			"@showprogress @threads for package in packages",
			"\t@eval using $(package)",
			"end"
		],
	},
	"usingplot": {
		"prefix": "usingplot",
		"body": [
			"using ProgressMeter",
			"packages = [:Plots, :Colors, :ColorSchemes]",
			"@showprogress for package in packages",
			"\t@eval using $(package)",
			"end",
			"using Plots: Plot, mm, cm"
		],
	},
	"usingthreads": {
		"prefix": "usingthreads",
		"body": [
			"using Base.Threads: @threads"
		],
	},
